Changes:
- code/ec2-scheduler.py: monthly and/or weekdays are support in EC2 instance tags
  for example:
  2230;0725;utc;mon,fri
  2230;0725;utc;weekdays
  none;1700;utc;mon,fri,1,31
- cform/ec2-scheduler.template.json :
  Add "kms.CreateGrant" permission to IAM role "ec2SchedulerRole" to fix issues of starting EC2 instance with encrypted EBS volume
  Modify S3 bucket name to dcp-install for customized lambda function code
